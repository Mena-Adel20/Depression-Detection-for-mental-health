Getting out of bed felt like a monumental task, and the thought of facing the day ahead filled me with a sense of dread.I tried to go through the motions, but everything felt gray and joyless. The things that used to bring me happiness now seem distant and unattainable. I can't shake this heavy feeling in my chest. It's like an anchor, pulling me down,I used to enjoy spending time with friends, but lately, the idea of socializing feels like an impossible challenge. It's easier to withdraw, to put on a facade and pretend everything is okay. I don't want anyone to worry about me, but the loneliness is suffocating.\"\n",
